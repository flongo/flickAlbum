## Public url

The application is deployed on [`https://flickralbum.herokuapp.com/src/index.html`](https://flickralbum.herokuapp.com/src/index.html)

## Start it locally

```
npm install
npm start
```

You can then target `http://localhost:8080/src/index.html`.

## Run test campaign

```
npm install
npm test
```

## Browser compatibility

The application has been tested on Chrome 51, Firefox 44 and Internet Explorer 11. Earlier versions of Internet Explorer have not been tested, but due to the `JSON` methods used in the code it certainly will not work on IE7.
